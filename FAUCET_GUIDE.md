## Troubleshooting

**"Faucet is empty" or "Rate limited"**
- Try again in a few hours
- Try a different faucet from the options above
- Join Discord and ask in #testnet-support

**"Transaction failed"**
- Make sure you're on the correct network (ZetaChain Athens Testnet)
- Clear your browser cache and try again

## Alternative: Deploy on Local Network

If you can't get testnet tokens, I can help you:
1. Set up a local Hardhat network for testing
2. Create a demo mode with mock data
3. Use a different testnet that's easier to access

Let me know which option you'd prefer!
